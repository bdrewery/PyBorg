PyBorg 1.1.0 needs Python 1.5.2 or greater (www.python.org).
The 'irclib' and 'ircbot' modules in the PyBorg archive were written by Joel
Rosdahl (www.rosdahl.net). PyBorg has been tested on linux and /may/ work on
other Python platforms.

Edit pyborg.cfg, and pyborg-irc.cfg (created the first time you run pyborg-irc)
to configure the bot. Type !help for a list of commands, and !help <command>
for specifics about that command.

'python pyborg-linein.py' to chat with the bot offline.
'python pyborg-irc.py' for irc mode.

Use convert2.py to convert pyborg olders dictionaries to pyborg 1.1.0
format. The dictionary is stored in lines.dat and words.dat and saved in a zip
file.

NOTE: Terminate the borg with the !quit command or CTRL-C in the
console. Do not simply close the console window or the dictionary
will not be saved.
