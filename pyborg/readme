PyBorg 1.1.0 needs Python 1.5.2 or greater (www.python.org).
The 'irclib' and 'ircbot' modules in the PyBorg archive were written by Joel
Rosdahl (www.rosdahl.net). PyBorg has been tested on linux, windows and BSD
and /may/ work on other Python platforms.

'python pyborg-linein.py' to chat with the bot offline.
'python pyborg-irc.py' for irc mode.

Use convert2.py to convert pyborg olders dictionaries to pyborg 1.1.0
format. The dictionary is stored in lines.dat and words.dat and saved in a zip
file.

Orders :
--------

All the orders start with one “!”. According to whether the bot is connected to
IRC or not, the list of the order is not the same one. Here the list of the
orders which are usable all the time:

    * !help: post the whole of the orders available
    * !version: post the version of the bot
    * !quit: leave the program
    * !save: safeguard the dictionary and the files of configuration

    * !words: post the number of words and sentences known
    * !known [Word]: post if the word [Word] is known and numbers it sentences
       in which it appears

    * !unlearn [Word]: erase the word of the dictionary
    * !purge: Post the number of words which appear only in one context
    * !purge [a number]: erase [a number] words of the dictionary, among the

    * !uncensor [Word]: withdraw [Word] list of censure

    * !learning [on|off]: authorize or not the training of new words

    * !alias: List all alias what exists
    * !alias [alias]: List all the words which refer to {alias]
    * !alias [alias] [word1] [wordN]: create alias which replaces all the events

    * !shutup: prevent the bot from speaking on the channels
    * !wakeup: cancel one! shutup
    * !replyrate [a number]: probability that the bot answers a message diffused

    * !talk [nick] [message]: send the message [message] with [nick] on behalf
       of the bot

    * !join [channel]: connect the bot to [channel]
    * !leaves [channel]: fact of leaving the channel [channel]
    * !chans: list the channels where the bot is connected

    * !uningore [nick]: withdraw nick list of the people to be ignored

    * !owner password: allows to be added to the list of the owners (the
       password is defined in the file pyborg-irc.cfg)

Configuration files :
---------------------

Edit pyborg.cfg, and pyborg-irc.cfg (created the first time you run pyborg-irc)
to configure the bot.

pyborg.cfg:

    * num_aliases: variable of the program, not to change, indicates the number
      of known alias
    * num_contexts: variable of the program, not to change, indicates the number
      of known sentences
    * ignore_list: indicate the list of words which are not relevant in a
      sentence (ex: [“one”, “a”, “of”, “some”]
    * max_words: maximum limit with the number of known words, can be changed
      thanks to the order !limit
    * learning: indicate if the bot must learn or not. Can be changed thanks to
      the order !learning
    * aliases: the list of alias. Can be changed with the order! alias
    * censored: the list of the censured words. Can be changed with the order
      !censor !uncensor
    * num_words: variable of the program, not to change, indicates the number of
      known words
    * no_save: if True, the program will not do any saves on disk.

pyborg-irc.cfg:

    * owners: a list of owners of the bot
    * reply_chance: percentage of chance that the bot answers a message diffused
      on the channel. Can be changed with the order! replyrate (see the order!
      replyrate)
    * reply_to_ignored: 0 or 1 make it possible to answer or not the people who
      in the list of are ignored
    * chans: a list channels one where the bot must be connected (is not
      modified by the order !join)
    * servers: a list of waiters where the bot must be connected
    * ignorelist: a list of people which the bot will not answer (see the order!
      be unaware of! unignore)
    * quit_message: message of exit to the disconnection
    * password: password for the order! owner
    * !speakin: 0 or 1 indicate if the bot must chatter on the channels, can be
      changed with the orders! shutup! wakeup

The aliases and censored words are regular expression. This mean that you can
set an aliases like '~hello': ['hell?o'] and each time pyborg will read 'hello'
or 'helo', it will replace the world by hello. The '~' as now role for now, but
says to pyborg that the word is an alias and can be used in the future.

NOTE: Terminate the borg with the !quit command or CTRL-C in the
console. Do not simply close the console window or the dictionary
will not be saved.
